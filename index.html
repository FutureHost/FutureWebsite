What are we
</h1>

<p> We are a small Group of people that wanna make Future More Automatic for you and not to worry about money because we give you free bots for your discord and you heard right Free BOTS for your Discord.. </p>


<h2>
<!-- Step 1 -->
Step One on Create your Bot
</h2>

<p>

First, you Must Join our Discord Server(Put the link in the discord word and delete this message) then go to the bot channel and type -new {Reason} By doing it a support member will contact you between 1-10 Hours due to lack of Staff Members. </p>


<h2>
<!--Step 2--> 
Step 2 Easy One </h2>

<p>
Step 2 is Easy and simple, you must tell the support staff what  you kind of bot you want, (Our List of bots are wanna be in the discord server or in this website ) when you finish ordering the bot your wanna wait between 1-4 Days for your bot to be Completed (Is Hard to Make Bot so don't beg your bot to be made before these days). </p>


<h2>
<!-- Step 3 -->
Step 3 Last Final Step </h2>

<p>
More Easy and Simple Step of the list and the last one, and is to receive the bot, the bot will be received and you will enjoy it as I enjoy working here 
ï¿¼
 but to add Your Bot we will send you an invite link to you (Warning if you send the invite link to someone else and if the invite keeps going in it will make the bot slower and maybe crash, BUT THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN. </p>


<h2>
<!-- Bonus -->
Custom Bot With Custom Commands </h2>

<p>

How to Make A Custom Bot for your server is easy you will need to follow the step show you atop in the website but you may stop in step 2 due you will no need to choose any of the bots listed down below (You Can Tell us What Commands to add or other features), BUT it will cost you over $0.50/month ( it is cheap) This is all Deals for today or tomorrow or forever. </p>

			<h2>Demonstrating the Box Model</h2>

<p>The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: borders, padding, margins, and the actual content.</p>

<div>This text is the actual content of the box. We have added a 25px padding, 25px margin and a 25px green border.
